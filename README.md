RDM4001 is a 3D engine by me (andi).

It is designed for FPS games and simple experiments, but within this repo are other types of software you can make with it (one is a ray marcher, the other is a 'board game')

It is licensed under the GNU GPLv3, but I am willing to dual license it for proprietary purposes (provided the pay is just...)

Dependencies: SDL2, SDL2_ttf, cglm, glm, OpenAL, assimp, ENet, Bullet3d, Boost (program_options), libsndfile
